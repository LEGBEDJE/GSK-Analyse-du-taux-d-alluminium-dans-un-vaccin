# GSK-Analyse-du-taux-d-alluminium-dans-un-vaccin

Data Analyst apprentice position – GlaxoSmithKline MSAT
Business problem:
Aluminum is commonly used in vaccine formulations as an adjuvant, a substance added to a vaccine to
enhance the body's immune response to the antigen. Aluminum salts, such as aluminum hydroxide or
aluminum phosphate, are the most widely used adjuvants in vaccines. Therefore, the aluminum content
is a critical quality attribute we want to control to ensure the final product quality.
As part of this assignment, you will be analyzing data related to a fictitious vaccine sample. Your
objective is to utilize exploratory data analysis techniques to address a business problem and provide
insights into the overall population. Here are some essential details regarding the vaccine:
•
•
The target aluminum content value for the vaccine is 1 mg/mL. Ideally, each batch's aluminum
content value should be as close as possible to this target value.
The specification ranges for the aluminum content are 0.8 - 1.2 mg/mL. To be considered as
"PASS," the aluminum content value for each batch must fall within this range.
Exercises:
You will be working with the Excel file named "data_apprentice_2024.xlsx" for the following exercises
(there is no link between these two exercises):
•
Exercise 1: The "Ex1" sheet contains data on aluminum content (in mg/mL) for different
vaccine batches produced between 2018 and 2022. As a Data Analyst, you will need to analyze
this data to provide insights to the production team. Here are some questions that you might
need to answer:
o Is the process stable? Are there any trends?
o Can we evaluate the quality of the process by comparing the data with the specification
ranges?
o Any additional information you have found?
Since Exercise 1 is mainly an open question, you are encouraged to explore the data and provide
your analysis.
•
Exercise 2: The "Ex2" sheet contains data on aluminum content (in mg/mL) for different
vaccine batches produced at site A and site B. The two sites are considered "equivalent" if the
mean difference is less than 0.1 mg/mL. In other words, if the mean difference falls within the
(-0.1 ; 0.1) mg/mL range, we can confirm equivalence. Based on this criterion, are sites A and
B equivalent? (Note that data from the same row are paired.)
General instructions:
No submission is required before the interview but be prepared to present your results to people with
various backgrounds or data science knowledge. Two main components that we would like to see:
•Technical skills: Your approach to statistical analysis and the tool(s) you have chosen (such as
R, Python, Excel, or Power BI). You are free to use the tool(s) that best suits your skill set.
•Communication skill: Your ability to effectively communicate the results of your analysis to
individuals without a technical background.
